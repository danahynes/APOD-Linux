unneeded code

all debug flags off

DONE - apod_linux_caption.sh
DONE - apod_linux_config_orig.py
DONE - apod_linux_config.py
DONE - apod_linux_login.sh
DONE - apod_linux.conf
DONE - apod_linux_unlock.sh
DONE - apod_linux.desktop
DONE - apod_linux.py
DONE - install.sh
DONE - uninstall.sh

DONE: blocks on call to apod_linux.py when clicking "apply"
DONE: why do we need full path to icon in .desktop?
DONE: desktop file (put in ~/.local/share/applications for current user
      or /usr/share/applications for all)
DONE: update README for gui
DONE: icon
DONE: better icon for dock
DONE: run from applications menu: shows up twice in plank
      first is labeled "APOD_Linux" goes away after a minute, one labeled
      "APOD_Linux config" stays until window closed
      first is for python launcher, second is for window?
DONE: make pages for text color/bg color/other
      or back to R/G/B/A spins
      wider not taller

SOME: project/github folders (like a folder just for gui stuff)
SOME: bottom space between text and background is too big (extra line?)
      side padding is 0, but top/bottom is still like 5px (cant get rid of it)

NA: add theme option to conf file and set theme at startup

TODO: run apod_linux_login.py at startup (but only for current user)
TODO: localize labels/buttons
TODO: localize apod_linux.desktop
