DONE: blocks on call to apod_linux.py when clicking "apply"
DONE: why do we need full path to icon in .desktop?
DONE: desktop file (put in ~/.local/share/applications for current user
      or /usr/share/applications for all)

SOME: icon (works in dock, but not overview, AND MUST BE SQUARE, overview
      might be a tkinter thing)
      see svg notes below
SOME: better icon for dock (not very sharp)
      need an icon in every size, need to put in every size in every location
      to account for every plank size
      128 seems to work for application menu, but plank is scaling
      maybe use an svg?
SOME: run from applications menu: shows up twice in plank
      first is labeled "APOD_Linux" goes away after a minute, one labeled
      "APOD_Linux config" stays until window closed
      first is for python launcher, second is for window?
      
SOME: make pages for text color/bg color/other
      or back to R/G/B/A spins
      wider not taller
SOME: project/github folders (like a folder just for gui stuff)
SOME: bottom space between text and background is too big (extra line?)
      side padding is 0, but top/bottom is still like 5px (cant get rid of it)

TODO: run apod_linux_login.py at startup (but only for current user)
